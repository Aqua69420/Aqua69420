	Interrogation  (child ModuleScript of PoliceSystem)   v246-v249, v257b dialogue

	v248 CRIME LOG - the secret truth of who did what. Every crime that goes through
	  Heat.addCrime is logged as an "event"; crimes of the same kind within LinkWindow
	  seconds and LinkRadius studs are the same event, its members are co-defendants.
	  Roles: Planner (first in on a robbery / burglary), Shooter (any violent crime),
	  Driver (did it from a vehicle seat), Lookout / Accomplice. Each member has an
	  evidence strength the police can prove (0-1), never shown to the suspect.
	  Co-defendants in custody are interviewed in different rooms and can't chat.

	v246 INTERROGATION - serious crimes, accomplices or thin evidence. A hold clock
	  (HoldSeconds, ~48 h of game time); Miranda; a clear "I want a lawyer" ends it,
	  "I'm not saying anything" pauses it.

	v257b THE CONVERSATION - two detectives (a good cop and a bad cop who trade places),
	  in phases:
	    1. Miranda: waive and talk, stay quiet, or ask for a lawyer
	    2. "Where were you?": home, the casino, with friends, don't remember, "why?"
	    3. evidence on the table - camera, prints, witness, phone. Each one is REAL or a
	       BLUFF (real more often when their case is strong). Call the bluff ("show me"),
	       deny it, explain it away (a lie = a QTE), no comment
	    4. pressure (family, silence, the death penalty, "your buddy talked") and the
	       deal pitch ("what happens if I cooperate?")
	  Side questions that don't cost a round: the charges, "am I free to go?", water,
	  a break, a phone call, whisper to your lawyer. Get angry ("go to hell") and the bad
	  cop leans in. Rarely a detective crosses the line - a promised deal, a threat, a
	  denied break - and that is recorded (DetectiveViolation) for the court.
	  A lawyer in the room (retained counsel who answered the arrest call) objects,
	  makes them show their evidence, and ends it: "charge my client or let him go".

	v247 QTEs - the character wants to talk; the player fights it (bite, breath, nerve,
	  eye, slip; "say it clearly" for the lawyer request when anxious; lying = slip /
	  nerve). Small miss = nervous tell; bigger = slip (evidence up); collapse = confession.

	v249 SNITCHING - tell the truth, blame someone (crewmate, someone who got away),
	  minimise, deny. Stories are cross-checked against the log; two people blaming the
	  same person is believed; lies are caught (false statement). First to give new info
	  gets the best deal. Snitch jacket (leaks -> SnitchedOn), protective custody.

	Outputs (player attributes + Records): InterrogationEvidence, Confessed,
	NamedAccomplices, LawyeredUp, Cooperative, CooperationDeal, FalseStatements,
	DetectiveViolation. run() returns { secsScale, extraCharges, ... }.
