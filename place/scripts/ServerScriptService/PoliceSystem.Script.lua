	GTA-style scaling police, player police, arrests and prison - one script.
	Built from separate modules; each one is a section below (search "MODULE:").
	Tuning lives in the Config section right below this header.

	  *      cops try to arrest you (tasers if you run)
	  **     wave 1 rolls out of the station, patrol cruisers answer the call
	  ***    wipe it -> shotguns + flashbangs
	  ****   wipe it -> SWAT, riot shields, helicopter
	  *****  wipe it -> heavy SWAT, 2 helicopters, rappelling; repeats bigger
	  Hands up (H) at any level: they stop shooting and cuff you.

	Other scripts: ServerStorage.ReportCrime:Invoke(player, "Bank robbery", stars)
	               ServerStorage.PoliceAI.ReportCrime:Fire(player, "BankRobbery", position)

	v113: tactical police AI (incidents, knowledge/LOS, arrest ownership, compliance,
	      coordinated vehicle pursuits, spike strips, roadblocks) lives in the child
	      ModuleScript folder  PoliceSystem.PoliceAI  - tune it in PoliceAI.Tuning.
	      If it fails to load, everything below keeps its previous behaviour.

	The vehicle is a "ghost car": a server-owned physics assembly steered with AlignPosition /
	AlignOrientation along a pathfinding route (sized for a car), hugging the ground with raycasts
	and pitching over slopes. That keeps it smooth for every client (physics replication is
	interpolated, anchored CFrame spam is not) and it can never flip, get stuck on a curb or
	fling a player. It brakes for people standing in front of it, parks short of the suspect,
	the squad piles out of the doors, and it despawns once nobody's looking.

	Lightbars, wheel spin and siren lights are animated on the clients (see PoliceClient).

	PoliceAI · Helicopter
	Air support. Flies in, orbits the suspect above the rooftops, spots them from the air (you
	have to get under a roof or out of its sight range to shake it), has a door gunner from
	4 stars, fast-ropes SWAT in at 5 stars, and can be shot down (it has a Humanoid, so most
	gun kits can damage it). Crashes explode and hurt anyone underneath.

	Rotor spin and the searchlight beam are drawn by the clients (PoliceClient); the server only
	sets the "SpotTarget" attribute a few times a second.

	PoliceAI · Crimes
	Works out who did what without needing your gun kit or NPCs to be rewritten:

	  · guns     – any Tool that looks like a gun (name keywords or IsGun attribute). Firing it
	               near a cop (heard or seen) = ShotsFired. Every shot is timestamped so the
	               damage code can tell who shot whom even when a kit doesn't tag victims.
	  · damage   – every Humanoid in Workspace is watched. Hurting someone in front of a cop =
	               Assault (1 star, cops try to cuff you). Killing someone = Murder.
	               Killing someone who already has 2+ stars is legal (bounty hunting).
	  · cars     – driving a car that belongs to another player = VehicleTheft.
	  · deaths   – dying ends your wanted level.

	Other scripts (bank heist, robberies, jail systems...) talk to the police through
	ServerStorage.PoliceAI:
	  ReportCrime:Fire(player, "BankRobbery", position?, extraHeat?)
	  SetWanted:Fire(player, stars)            -- 0 clears
	  GetWanted:Invoke(player) -> stars        -- or read player:GetAttribute("WantedStars")
	  Cleared.Event(player, reason)            -- "Evaded" | "Busted" | "Died" | "Left" | ...
	  Busted.Event(player)

GOAL: finish spatial validation and Studio playtesting. Architecture is intentionally strict: NO teleport fallback may advance Intake, Booking, Housing, or Release.
CURRENT FLOW: Arrest -> cruiser -> correctional handoff -> Intake CO physical walking escort -> Intake cell -> Booking CO physical walking escort -> Booking cell -> counsel phone/case review -> classification while still in booking -> Housing CO physical walking escort -> real classified cell -> ONLY THEN Prisoners team + sentence timer. Release/bail uses Release CO physical escort to outside before restoring civilian team.
SECURITY: Low, Medium, High, Maximum, Supermax, Death Row. Murder can produce reduced long sentences, life/Supermax, or Death Row; counsel changes probabilities but never guarantees outcome.
YOUR JOB IN ROBLOX STUDIO:
1. Inspect Workspace.CorrectionalFacility, Workspace.PrisonMap, Explorer and navigation mesh. Catalog every actual usable cell and assign/verify categories LowSecurity, MediumSecurity, HighSecurity, MaximumSecurity, Supermax, DeathRow, IntakeCell, BookingCell. Prefer tags/attributes/mapper objects over hardcoded coordinates.
2. Inspect every restricted door/gate between vehicle handoff, intake, booking, each housing block, and release exit. Authorized Police/Prison Staff NPCs must open it before crossing, walk prisoner through, then allow it to close/relock. Criminals must not gain access.
3. Run multiplayer Studio tests. Follow the CO and prisoner visually. If BookingState becomes EscortBlocked or EscortFailure is set, DO NOT add a teleport. Inspect that exact location, collision, door model, stairs, PathfindingModifier/navmesh, agent radius/height and repair the route/environment.
4. Remove remaining long-distance hardcoded/fallback spatial assumptions where the real building can be discovered. The small unboard placement beside the cruiser is acceptable; stage-to-stage teleportation is not.
5. Verify booking phone/counsel UI remains usable while physically held in Booking. Classification must not move the detainee out of Booking until Housing CO arrives.
6. Verify team remains the pre-arrest team during Intake/Booking. Prisoners team and SentenceEnd may be assigned ONLY after Housing CO reaches the assigned real cell. Sentence must not tick during transport/intake/booking.
7. Verify bail/dismissal/served sentence: Release CO physically collects player, traverses doors, reaches outside, THEN clears custody/restores previous civilian team/property. No respawn into a prison spawn.
8. Test at least Low, Medium, Maximum, Supermax and Death Row assignments plus bail and served release. Test two simultaneous prisoners for cell occupancy conflicts.
9. Preserve casino, bank, vehicles, road mapper, police/SWAT and unrelated systems. Make backups before broad edits.
DONE CRITERIA: one complete arrest-to-release test and one murder-to-high-security/death-row test complete with zero processing teleports, no roof placement, every necessary door visibly operated, no EscortBlocked state, and Output contains no prison pipeline errors.
IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTICS: search Output for CUSTODY, PRISON ROAD ARRIVAL, PRISON FINAL APPROACH, INTAKE CUSTODY HANDOFF, INTAKE CELL, BOOKING ARRIVED, CLASSIFICATION IN BOOKING, HOUSING COMPLETE, ESCORT BLOCKED, RELEASE START, RELEASE COMPLETE.


V93 INCIDENT/SECURITY CORE ADDED BEFORE ASTRA:
- IncidentController now assigns server-authoritative tactical roles (Contact/Arrest/Cover/Containment/LessLethal/Shield/Search) to cops on each pursuit and records incident IDs/last sightings. Continue by making CopAI behavior consume these roles more deeply when selecting cover and sectors.
- AI and player tasers now use an authoritative raycast and visible attached probe/wire effect; walls/cover block the shot and misses do not stun. Playtest character rigs and tune presentation.
- PrisonAuthorization service added. Create/map semantic zones in Workspace.PrisonZones or tag them PrisonZone. Zone attributes supported: Priority, AlwaysAuthorized, EscortAllowed, AllowedCustodyStages, AllowedClasses, AllowedSchedules, HousingUnit. Authorization is dynamic and separate from detection.
- Escape now preserves EscapeRemainingSentence instead of deleting the unserved term. Integrate recapture so it restores the suspended term and adds the escape case outcome.
- Config.Incident, Config.Pursuit and Config.PrisonSecurity added. Pursuit config explicitly anticipates Road Mapper V2 lane/direction/speed attributes.

REQUIRED ASTRA FOLLOW-UP: spatially map prison zones, towers, airspace and guard sightlines; build actual cover scoring/selection; finish pursuit primary/secondary/intercept/spike/roadblock behavior against the expanded Road Mapper; test taser probes; test two-player incidents/transports; and verify no normal custody stage teleports. Do not treat the presence of these architecture hooks as proof of completed Studio behavior.

V94 PRE-ASTRA PASS:
- CopAI now CONSUMES IncidentRole for tactical behavior. Cover/containment/search roles are kept out of the central arrest pile; Cover performs runtime occlusion sampling against real world geometry. This is intentionally conservative and MUST be tuned visually in Studio.
- Added PrisonSchedule driven by Lighting.ClockTime. Default blocks: Count, Chow, Programs, Yard, Lockdown. Supermax and Death Row default to Lockdown. Zone AllowedSchedules remains the final permission layer, so Astra must configure real zones for the actual prison.
- Removed the remaining correctional vehicle PivotTo fallback. If the road/access path cannot physically reach intake, BookingState becomes TransportBlocked and the prisoner remains secured in the vehicle. Fix the real road/access geometry; DO NOT re-add a teleport.
- Existing v93 authoritative taser probe/wire and IncidentController remain.

ASTRA PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION/PLAYTEST LIST:
A. Open the game in Studio and read this entire ASTRA_HANDOFF first. Make a backup.
B. Map semantic PrisonZones from the ACTUAL CorrectionalFacility geometry. Configure AllowedCustodyStages, AllowedClasses, AllowedSchedules, HousingUnit, EscortAllowed and Priority. Validate Intake becomes unauthorized after handoff to Booking; Yard access changes with schedule/classification; lockdown restricts movement appropriately.
C. Inspect/fix the physical correctional vehicle route from the mapped roads to PoliceHandoff/Intake. TransportBlocked must be solved with roads, gates, collision/nav geometry or a legitimate drivable access path, never PivotTo/CFrame teleportation.
D. Finish tower guards/spotlights and prison perimeter + low-altitude airspace. Unauthorized presence is NOT automatically detected. Alarm/wanted response begins from valid guard/camera/tower LOS. Overlap tower sectors, raycast LOS, and preserve last-known position after sight is lost.
E. Playtest IncidentController roles at bank/casino/street scenes. Improve cover scoring using actual geometry; ensure cops spread, contain exits, shield units lead appropriate pushes, less-lethal officers work behind cover/shields, and only a small arrest team rushes a stunned/surrendering suspect. Do not make officers omniscient.
F. Finish VEHICLE PURSUIT DIRECTOR against the expanded Road Mapper: primary + secondary only directly chase; parallel/intercept units route ahead using road direction/speed; implement physical spike-strip deployment and roadblocks. Spike officer must arrive ahead, deploy safely, individual wheel contact should degrade handling, and following police should avoid/recover the strip. Police may lose a pursuit if visual contact and containment are genuinely broken.
G. MULTI-SUSPECT: implement/test server-authoritative transport manifests and actual secure-seat capacity. Two arrested suspects may share a cruiser if it has two prisoner seats, arrive together, then MUST be separated into independent intake cells/cases. Test 1, 2, and 3+ suspects requiring multiple transports.
H. TASER: visually test both probes/wires/effects on the actual rigs. Keep authoritative raycast contact and obstruction. Improve local stun camera/audio/animation/ragdoll presentation without arcade lightning.
I. ESCAPE/RECAPTURE: zone authorization and detection are separate. Preserve EscapeRemainingSentence; on confirmed detection create alarm/wanted response. Recapture must restore unserved term plus escape disposition and physically re-enter secure processing.
J. RELEASE: physical Release CO path from cell through all secure doors to outside. Restore team/property only after outside handoff.

FINAL ACCEPTANCE TESTS:
1) bank robbery -> coordinated containment -> vehicle pursuit -> spike/intercept attempt -> foot transition -> less-lethal/arrest -> physical transport -> intake;
2) two suspects arrested and transported together when capacity permits, then separated at intake;
3) Low/Medium/Maximum/Supermax/Death Row schedule-zone authorization including Yard and lockdown;
4) prisoner intentionally enters wrong zone: internal Unauthorized state first, then alarm only when actual security obtains LOS;
5) genuine escape + loss/reacquisition of sight + recapture with remaining sentence preserved;
6) served/dismissed release physically escorted outside;
7) zero normal-flow custody teleports, no roof placement, no silent stage advancement after navigation failure.

PRESERVE: CasinoServer, multiplayer blackjack, CarServer/player car controls, MenuServer, Road Mapper, bank systems, existing sirens/helicopters/visual effects, and unrelated working content. Improve them only where required for this task.

	PoliceAI · Dispatcher
	The "police department". Decides how many cops exist and where they come from.

	  PATROLS   population = Base + PerPlayer × players (capped). Spawned out of sight near
	            players (or at your patrol points), recycled when far from everyone, topped up
	            after a delay when killed.
	  1 STAR    nearest patrols respond and try to arrest. If nobody's around, a patrol unit
	            is sent from off-screen.
	  2+ STARS  waves come out of the police station (run if it's close, drive if it's far,
	            appear off-screen if there's no station). Kill enough of a wave and you gain
	            a star; after a short breather the next, heavier wave rolls. At 5 stars every
	            wave you break comes back bigger. A wave that's still fighting after a while
	            gets reinforcements. Helicopters join per tier; at 5 stars SWAT fast-rope in.
